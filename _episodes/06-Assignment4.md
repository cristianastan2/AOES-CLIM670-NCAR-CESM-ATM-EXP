### What am I expected to do for Assignment #4

1. Run your assigned SST combination from the Drought Working Group for 10 years

P=Pacific; A=Atlantic

n = climatology (no SST anomaly)

w = 2*SST anomaly

c = -2 * SST anomaly

PwAw: Amber

PcAc: Loren

Climatology: Cristina 

2. When your data is ready, tell the class where to find it.  I will do the same for the climatology experiment.

3. Make a plot of the difference between the annual mean for your experiment and the climatology experiment for precipitation and surface temperature over the continental US for each experiment.  This will make 2 2-panel figures.  One for preciptiation and one for surface temperature.
