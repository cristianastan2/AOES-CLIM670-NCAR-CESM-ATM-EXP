### What am I expected to do for Assignment #3

1. Run your assigned SST combination from the Drought Working Group for 10 years

P=Pacific; A=Atlantic
n = climatology (no SST anomaly)
w = 2*SST anomaly
c = -2 * SST anomaly

PwAw: Douglas, Sherry
PwAn: Mary, Joshi
PwAc: Zack
PnAw: Hsin
PnAn: Scott
PnAc: Nikki
PcAw: Finley
PcAn: Rachel
PcAc: Bradley

Climatology: Kathy

To do this, you will need to expand your SST data file to contain 10 years of data.  This should be the same data repeated. 

2. When your data is ready, tell the class where to find it.  I will do the same for the climatology experiment.

3. Make a plot of the difference between the annual mean for your experiment and the climatology experiment for precipitation and surface temperature over the continental US for each experiment.  This will make 2 9-panel figures.  One for preciptiation and one for surface temperature. 

### To turn in the assignemnt

Point me to the location of your figures/notebook or send me your figure.
